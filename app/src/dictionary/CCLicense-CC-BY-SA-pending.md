### Xinbian Riyu (新编日语)

Xinbian Riyu may be a copyright problem for this software. I'll try my best to
fix it later or get it offline. The reason I use the vocabulary list in Xinbian
Riyu is that it's the textbook for a lot of teachers and students. That means
the teacher will use the exact meaning in the textbook for their quiz with no
derivation. However, I only found the copyright licence for their digital
content. I didn't find the copyright licence for their written content.
